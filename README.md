At Tool TL;DR, we are pretty low-tech and we needed a contact form, but also wanted some public facing roadmap. GitHub and their 'issues' page work pretty good for this type of thing. Add issues to the 'issues' tab page if you have questions, concerns, problems, or suggestions for [tooltldr.com](https://tooltldr.com).
