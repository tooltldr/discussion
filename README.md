# Tool TL;DR Discussion

At Tool TL;DR, we are pretty low-tech and we needed a contact form, but also wanted some kind of loose, public facing roadmap. GitHub and their 'issues' page work pretty well for this type of thing so, for the time being, this will be the public contact form for Tool TL;DR.

Add issues to the 'issues' tab page if you have questions, concerns, problems, or suggestions for [tooltldr.com](https://www.tooltldr.com).

**Note:** we aren't open-source right now, we only have this repo to use the 'Issues' feature.
